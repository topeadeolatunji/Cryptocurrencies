# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
For this module, I am partnering with Martha, a senior manager for one of our top clients. Accountability Accounting, which is an esteemed investment bank, is interested in offering a new product. This product is a cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is quite overwhelmed in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. They requested that I create a report that includes the cryptocurrencies currently on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the new investment.

The .csv file data Martha and I will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit into the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we determined that it is an unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. Weâ€™ll use data visualizations to share relevant findings with the board of Accountability Accounting.
